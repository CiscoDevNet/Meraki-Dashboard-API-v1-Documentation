### What's Changed
---
`POST` /organizations/{organizationId}/actionBatches Create an action batch  
    Parameters

        Add createOrganizationActionBatch
        createOrganizationActionBatch change into required
`GET` /networks/{networkId}/cameras/{serial}/videoLink Returns video link to the specified camera. If a timestamp is supplied, it links to that timestamp.  
    Parameters

        Add timestamp //[optional] The video link will start at this timestamp. The timestamp is in UNIX Epoch time (milliseconds). If no timestamp is specified, we will assume current time.
        timestamp Notes The video link will start at this timestamp. The timestamp is in UNIX Epoch time (milliseconds). change into [optional] The video link will start at this timestamp. The timestamp is in UNIX Epoch time (milliseconds). If no timestamp is specified, we will assume current time.
`GET` /networks/{networkId}/clients/{clientId}/latencyHistory Return the latency history for a client. Clients can be identified by a client key or either the MAC or IP depending on whether the network uses Track-by-IP. The latency data is from a sample of 2% of packets and is grouped into 4 traffic categories: background, best effort, video, voice. Within these categories the sampled packet counters are bucketed by latency in milliseconds.  
    Parameters

        Add timespan //The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 791 days. The default is 1 day.
`GET` /networks/{networkId}/devices/{serial}/lldp_cdp List LLDP and CDP information for a device  
    Parameters

        Add timespan //The timespan for which LLDP and CDP information will be fetched. Must be in seconds and less than or equal to a month (2592000 seconds). LLDP and CDP information is sent to the Meraki dashboard every 10 minutes. In instances where this LLDP and CDP information matches an existing entry in the Meraki dashboard, the data is updated once every two hours. Meraki recommends querying LLDP and CDP information at an interval slightly greater than two hours, to ensure that unchanged CDP / LLDP information can be queried consistently.
`GET` /networks/{networkId}/devices/{serial}/lossAndLatencyHistory Get the uplink loss percentage and latency in milliseconds for a wired network device.  
    Parameters

        Add timespan //The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 31 days. The default is 1 day.
        Add uplink //The WAN uplink used to obtain the requested stats. Valid uplinks are wan1, wan2, cellular. The default is wan1.
        Add ip //The destination IP used to obtain the requested stats. This is required.
