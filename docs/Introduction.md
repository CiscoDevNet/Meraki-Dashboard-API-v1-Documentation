## What's New in v1 

The Dashboard API has evolved significantly, providing hundreds of endpoints to manage your Meraki networks. With this growth, it started to become challenging to find resources quickly. Meraki prides itself on simplicity and to that end, the API has been restructured to provide a more intuitive experience for working with the API. 

In addition, several improvements and new endpoints have been included with this major release.

## Highlights

### API Documentation

The API documentation and complimenting Postman Collection will be structured based on General and Product service groups, which will then contain the related resources.

    ```Endpoint Domains
    General
        devices
        networks
        organizations
    Products
        appliance
        camera
        switch
        wireless
        ...
    ```

- Each product or scope will have a **CONFIGURE** and/or **MONITOR** folder, to indicate the types of endpoints that are available and the permissions likely required. 

    ```Endpoint Types
    Products
        appliance
            CONFIGURE
                firewall
                
            MONITOR
                performance
    ```


### Resource Path changes

The endpoint URL paths will always contain the Meraki product, reducing ambiquity when working with resources. 

```Product Service Groups

    `/appliance/ports`

    `/switch/ports`
```

### Authorization

The API calls will now use an Authorization Bearer token, per industry standards.

    

    ```header
    {
        "Authorization": Bearer <Meraki_API_Key>
    }
    ```
