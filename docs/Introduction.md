## What's New in v1 

The Dashboard API has evolved significantly, providing hundreds of endpoints to manage your Meraki networks. With this growth, it started to become challenging to find resources quickly. Meraki prides itself on simplicity and to that end, the API has been restructured to provide a more intuitive experience for working with the API. 

In addition, several improvements and new endpoints have been included with this major release.

## Highlights

### API Documentation

The API Endpoint documentation and complimenting Postman Collection are now structured based on General and Product service groups, which will then contain the related resources.


**Endpoint Domains**


- General
    - devices
    - networks
    - organizations
- Products
    - appliance
    - camera
    - cellularGateway
    - insight
    - sm
    - switch
    - wireless

Each product or scope will have a **CONFIGURE** and/or **MONITOR** folder, to indicate the types of endpoints that are available and the permissions likely required. 


**Endpoint Types**

    - appliance
        - CONFIGURE
            - firewall         
        - MONITOR
            - performance

### Resource Path changes

The endpoint URL paths will always contain the Meraki product if required, reducing ambiguity when working with resources that have similar yet unique functionality. 

**Product Service Groups Examples**

`/appliance/ports`

`/switch/ports`


### Authorization

The API calls will now use an Authorization Bearer token, per industry standards.

**Request Header**

```json
{
    "Authorization": Bearer <Meraki_API_Key>
}
```
