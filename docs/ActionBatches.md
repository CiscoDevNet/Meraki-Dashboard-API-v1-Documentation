Action Batches are a special type of Dashboard API mechanism for submitting batched configuration requests in a single synchronous or asynchronous transaction. Action Batches are ideal for bulk configuration, either in the initial provisioning process, or for rolling out wide-scale configuration changes. For example, add a switch to a network, configure all 48 ports, and set the switchâ€™s management interface in a single POST.

## Use Cases
* Deploy multiple changes across networks and devices
* Run Batches synchronously or asynchronously 
* Avoid hitting the API rate limit for high-scale configuration changes
* Ensure all updates will succeed before changes are committed

## Details
* Action batches allow an API client to define a batch of write actions (**create**, **update**, **destroy**, etc.).
* Batches are run **atomically** (all or nothing, no partial success).
* Batches are run **asynchronously** by default. Smaller batches can be run **synchronously**.
* You can run up to **20 resources** synchronously in a single batch.
* A batch can consists of up to **100** resources.
* Limit of **5** concurrent running batches at a time.
* A batch should be completed within **10 minutes** from confirmation.
* Different types of resources and operations can be combined in a batch.
* The actions in a batch will be executed in the same order they are defined.
* Batches will not be executed until the confirmed property is set. Once a batch is confirmed it cannot be deleted. If a batch is defined but not confirmed it will be **automatically deleted after one week**.

## Create an Action Batch
To create an Action Batch, you will need to send a POST request containing an array or resources to be updated and whether or not it should run immediately. You can also select if the batch should run synchronously or asynchronously depending on the size of the batch.

```
POST /organizations/{organizationId}/actionBatches
```

### PARAMETERS
**Parameter**|**Description**
:-------------: |:-------------:
confirmed| Set to true for immediate execution. Set to false if the action should be previewed before executing.
synchronous| Force the batch to run synchronous. There can be at most 20 actions in synchronous batch.
actions| A set of changes to make as part of this action
resource| Unique identifier for the resource to be acted on
operation| The operation to be run on the resource, such as "**create**", "**update**", "**destroy**", "**bind**", etc
body| The body of the action. Example: `{"tags": tags, "type": "access", "vlan": vlan}`

# Example Script

This example Python script will create a new VLAN on a Meraki MX Security Appliance. It will then update multiple switches with new tags. Finally, several ports will be updated to leverage the new VLAN settings. 

```python
# actionBatch-VlanUpdate.py
