# Overview

In our pursuit to offer a seamless digital experience, we have introduced a new concept of **Integrated APIs** within the `api.meraki.com` namespace. 

These APIs are distinctive as they serve as seamless connectors to various systems, effectively bridging the gap between the multitude of software solutions we encounter.

## Features and Considerations

1. **Passthrough Nature:** Integrated APIs are primarily designed to be passthrough conduits to other systems within the api.meraki.com namespace.

2. **Early Access Gated:** Due to the nature of the Integrated API operations, they don't fully comply with the Meraki API standards and serve as "Early Access" operations.

3. **Fluidity in Design:** Given their early access phase, users should be aware that the Integrated APIs are fluid and subject to changes at any moment. This inherent nature allows us to adapt and innovate faster.

4. **Transitioning Over Time:** We aim to improve and evolve continually. As such, over time, Integrated APIs will either be phased out or replaced by APIs that fully align with the Meraki API standards.

5. **Documentation Process:** Our commitment is to provide a clear understanding of the Integrated API operation functionality.

6. **Response Data Inclusion:** The response payload from the Integrated API may consist of data sourced from the various systems it interfaces with.

Integrated APIs, while transitional, play a pivotal role in our current digital ecosystem. They act as the intermediary bridge, ensuring systems communicate effectively. As we progress, we invite our users to explore, utilize, and provide feedback, aiding in the evolution of Meraki's digital solutions.
