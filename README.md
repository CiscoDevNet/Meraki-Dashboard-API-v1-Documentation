# Getting Started

Here is a simple guide to add files and also preview your document.

## Step 1 : Modify or replace the intro.md and getting-started.md files

Modify or replace `intro.md` and `getting-started.md` with the files for your project. If you need to add more then one file to this repo we suggest using source tree. Never used source tree? [Click here to learn how

## Step 2 : Edit the config.json file

You will need to edit the `config.json` file. This file sets up the left-hand navigation for your documentation. [Click here to learn how to set up the config.json](https://pubhub.cisco.com/preview/579/new/#!adding-items-to-the-navigation-pane/adding-items-to-the-navigation-pane).

## Step 3 : Go back to PubHub to preview and submit for review

Once you finished steps 1 and 2 and `committed` your files, go back to your [project](https://pubhub.cisco.com/detail/2399/) on PubHub. There you can preview your document and also submit it to go live on DevNet.
